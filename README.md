The prime objective of “Hamro Restaurant” Application is to create a full-fledged Android application which could locate a list of restaurants based on the location and type of the cuisine entered by the user. The user not only finds all the restaurants in the city, but also, they can make a choice of the best restaurant based on the rating.  The user can also map the location of the restaurant on Google Maps rendered to the user on the phone and find the path from the user current location or from any other location to the restaurant.  The user has the facility to make a call directly to the restaurants and can also obtain the detailed review provided by the others users. They can also send their own review and even suggest to their friends.  During the development of the project we went through development of various stages of requirement collection, system design, development to testing and maintenance. To develop the project,  Android , JAVA, and XML is used in the front end of the mobile application whereas SQLITE and Java, is used as a backend. The application uses Java Framework with XML, and SQLITE.  System is tested and error is identified by using unit testing, system testing and integrated testing approaches. Hence, „Hamro Restaurant‟ is made as the digital solution, which also aid in a step towards the development of Smart and Digital Nepal.
